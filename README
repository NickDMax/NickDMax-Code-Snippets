This repositor contains code snippets from my blog and from verious posts that I feel
deserver a little source control.

These snippets and programs are available for you to use as you see fit within the 
guidelines of a CC 3.0 license. If you find the code particularly useful please
send me an email or tweet (@NickDMax) telling me how my work may have contributed
to the greater good. If it was not helpful, or you think it is terrible, or you think
that I am terrible etc. please feel free to keep that to yourself, your blog, your 
friends etc. but you don't have to take the time to inform me.

I do however appreciate contructive critisism and comment.
